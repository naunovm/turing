	"argument" : "Prior to Presidentt Biden taking office I was very excited to see him carry out policies, ideas, and hopes he laid out for the nation. I don't feel like a lot of this has been accomplished, but I recognize this might not be all his fault, since this is the way our government has been set up to work. I am glad he has attempted to rebuild relationships broken in the previous presidency as well as put the US back in important treaties/agreements. This being said there are things like his response/role in the Middle East that I don't agree with, but there are other positive things he has done as well. Overall I have mixed feelings about Biden's performance overall. "
